# Repository Analysis

Phase 5 converts a deterministic `RepositoryManifest` into a focused
`RepositoryAnalysis`. It does not execute repository code, build an execution
plan, search the web, or declare whether a repository is reproducible.

## Deterministic-first extraction

`RepositoryAnalyzer` reads a bounded set of repository-local evidence and uses
standard-library parsers or conservative pattern extraction for:

* `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, and `setup.cfg` package metadata;
* `requirements*.txt` and Conda environment files;
* pytest/tox configuration and Make targets;
* Docker base-image, Python, and CUDA hints;
* GitHub Actions Python versions and commands;
* documented README/INSTALL setup, test, and run commands;
* documented environment-variable names, external assets, checkpoints, and
  explicit GPU requirements.

`setup.py` is never imported or executed. Target dependencies are not installed
during analysis.

## Analysis model and provenance

`RepositoryAnalysis` records project/runtime hints, package manager,
dependencies, install/test/run commands, entrypoints, environment-variable
names, assets, GPU/network requirements, a likely execution target, conflicts,
context-file names, and confidence.

Important claims retain `AnalysisEvidence` with one of three provenance values:

```text
DOCUMENTED
DETERMINISTICALLY_DETECTED
LLM_INFERRED
```

Conflicting documentation is retained instead of being silently replaced. For
example, a README Python version that contradicts `requires-python` becomes an
explicit conflict.

## Bounded context

Optional interpretation receives only relevant manifest files. Defaults allow
at most 20 files, 64 KiB per file, and 120,000 total characters. Absolute and
parent-relative paths, symlinks, `.git`, binary files, and oversized files are
excluded. Credential-shaped assignments are redacted before context is built.
Datasets, checkpoints, generated trees, and arbitrary source files are not
collected.

## Optional LLM interpretation

Deterministic analysis runs without an LLM. A Phase 4 `LLMProvider` is consulted
only when the likely execution target remains ambiguous or deterministic and
documented evidence conflicts. The response must use the
`supplement_analysis` action and its arguments must validate as the narrow
`AnalysisInference` schema.

LLM inference can add explicitly marked hypotheses, but it cannot overwrite a
stronger deterministic project type, execution target, GPU conclusion, or asset
finding. Normal tests use `MockLLMProvider`; no live provider or API key is
required.

## Limitations

The extractor is intentionally conservative. It does not fully interpret
arbitrary shell scripts, dynamic `setup.py` logic, YAML semantics, or prose. It
does not perform web search, download assets, create a reproduction plan, run
commands, or verify outcomes. Those are separate later phases.
